Arrays
30 April, 2022
Where can arrays be used?
•	Arrays should be used where the number of elements to be stored is already known.
•	Arrays are commonly used in computer programs to organize data so that a related set of values can be easily sorted or searched.
•	Generally, when we require very fast access times, we usually prefer arrays since they provide O(1) access times.
•	Arrays work well when we have to organize data in multidimensional format. We can declare arrays of as many dimensions as we want.
•	If the index of the element to be modified is known beforehand, it can be efficiently modified using arrays due to quick access time and mutability.

Disadvantages of arrays
•	Since arrays are fixed-size data structures you cannot dynamically alter their sizes. It creates a problem when the number of elements the array is going to store is not known beforehand.
•	Insertion and Deletion in arrays are difficult and costly since the elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, hence, we need to shift the elements to create/delete space for elements.
•	If more memory is allocated than required, it leads to the wastage of memory space and less allocation of memory also leads to a problem.
